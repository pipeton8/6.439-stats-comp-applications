In that sense, the study was not blinded, as both treatment and control groups knew their assignment prior to treatment. Usign this design, it is impossible to detect to a greater level of cofidence the effects of the vaccine. At least two sources of bias can be identified for this design:\n",

This could imply these students have different chances of getting polio, regardless the vaccine, which will bias the results. In fact, comparing groups from grades 1 and 3, with those from the no consent group, can lead us to conclude these groups are not similar.\n",

This could also affect the rates of polio of 1st and 3rd graders if these students are continously sharing spaces at school.

In this case, each student was randomly assigned to a treatment group (and got the vaccine) or a control group (and got a placebo). Observational data was obtained from those students that did not consent to participate (the <i>No consent</i> group). A design like this one is better suited to estimate the effects of the vaccine, as potential confounders are now (in average) equal between both groups. However, the second source of bias is not completely eliminated if treatment is not randomized at school level. That is, if within the same school there are children that belong to both treatment and control groups, then the vaccine effect is biased downwards (i.e. a lower bound of its efficacy is estimated) due to peer effects. In that case, vaccinated children indirectly protect those that only receive a salt injection.\n",

For example, if the vaccinated children has a sibling in 1st or 3rd grade, or if there is an elderly relative in the house. In class, there are 2nd graders that did not get the vaccine because they did not consent to participate in the study.

First, those rates where obtained in a situation where parents made their decisions without previous knowledge of results from a similar design experiment. Hence, their selection into consenting or not consenting to participate is driven by a different set of characteristics that for this second time. Second, and most importantly, the previous discussion suggested that the lower rate of contagion for students in the <i>No consent</i> group could be driven by an indirect protection from their schoolmates. This, in particular, depends on people consenting to participate. Otherwise, the expected rates of contagion could be as high as the ones obtained for the control group.\n",
