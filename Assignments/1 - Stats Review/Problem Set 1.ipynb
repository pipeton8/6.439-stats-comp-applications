In that sense, the study was not blinded, as both treatment and control groups knew their assignment prior to treatment. Usign this design, it is impossible to detect to a greater level of cofidence the effects of the vaccine. At least two sources of bias can be identified for this design:\n",
        " <ol type=\"1\">\n",
        "    <li> Students in 2nd grade are no necessarily comparable to younger or older students, even from the same school. Differences can be related to exposure to the virus but also to other confounders like gender distribution, parents age and education, amonng other. This could imply these students have different chances of getting polio, regardless the vaccine, which will bias the results. In fact, comparing groups from grades 1 and 3, with those from the no consent group, can lead us to conclude these groups are not similar.\n",
        "    </li><br>\n",
        "    <li> Being polio an infectous disease, peer effects can be substantial in confounding the effects of the vaccine. This implies that students from second grade that did not consent to the vaccine got protected by their schoolmates by a weaker version of herd immunity. This could also affect the rates of polio of 1st and 3rd graders if these students are continously sharing spaces at school. This could also be important if students from the control and treatment groups both belong to the same school.\n",

In this case, each student was randomly assigned to a treatment group (and got the vaccine) or a control group (and got a placebo). Observational data was obtained from those students that did not consent to participate (the <i>No consent</i> group). A design like this one is better suited to estimate the effects of the vaccine, as potential confounders are now (in average) equal between both groups. However, the second source of bias is not completely eliminated if treatment is not randomized at school level. That is, if within the same school there are children that belong to both treatment and control groups, then the vaccine effect is biased downwards (i.e. a lower bound of its efficacy is estimated) due to peer effects. In that case, vaccinated children indirectly protect those that only receive a salt injection.\n",
