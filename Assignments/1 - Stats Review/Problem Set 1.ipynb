This could imply these students have different chances of getting polio, regardless the vaccine, which will bias the results. In fact, comparing groups from grades 1 and 3, with those from the no consent group, can lead us to conclude these groups are not similar.\n",

This could also affect the rates of polio of 1st and 3rd graders if these students are continously sharing spaces at school.

In this case, each student was randomly assigned to a treatment group (and got the vaccine) or a control group (and got a placebo). Observational data was obtained from those students that did not consent to participate (the <i>No consent</i> group). A design like this one is better suited to estimate the effects of the vaccine, as potential confounders are now (in average) equal between both groups. However, the second source of bias is not completely eliminated if treatment is not randomized at school level. That is, if within the same school there are children that belong to both treatment and control groups, then the vaccine effect is biased downwards (i.e. a lower bound of its efficacy is estimated) due to peer effects.

For example, if the vaccinated children has a sibling in 1st or 3rd grade, or if there is an elderly relative in the house. In class, there are 2nd graders that did not get the vaccine because they did not consent to participate in the study.

First, those rates where obtained in a situation where parents made their decisions without previous knowledge of results from a similar design experiment. Hence, their selection into consenting or not consenting to participate is driven by a different set of characteristics that for this second time. Second, and most importantly, the previous discussion suggested that the lower rate of contagion for students in the <i>No consent</i> group could be driven by an indirect protection from their schoolmates. This, in particular, depends on people consenting to participate. Otherwise, the expected rates of contagion could be as high as the ones obtained for the control group.\n",

        "<font size=\"2\" color=\"#03bafc\"> There are multiple problems with this approach. First, given a certain significance threshold it is highly likely to obtain significant results if testing multiple hypothesis without correction. However, even if the tests are corrected fro multiple hypothesis testing, other problems arise. As mentioned in the Wasserstein and Lazar (2016), at least four caveats can be mentioned for this approach:\n",
        "<ol type=\"1\"><font size=\"2\" color=\"#03bafc\"> \n",
        "  <li> The stastistically significance of the variables is \"only a measure about data in relation to a specified hypothetical explanation\", which in this case is the coefficient of the variable not being zero. This is, we have evidence to reject the idea that the variable in particular is not helpful in <i>linearly predicting</i> the outcume, albeit there is no idea of causality involved.\n",
        "  </li>\n",
        "  <li> If we present the policymakers only the statistically significant variables and do not report how the results were obtained, it is impossible to draw clear and useful conclusions for policymaking. Like the paper mentioned, $p$-values are uninterpretable in abscence of the models that produced them. After all, $p$-values are by definition tied to a certain statistical model and assumptions.\n",
        "  </li>\n",
        "  <li> The variable being statistically significant does not mean the effect it could have on the outcome is big, or cost-effective to be a good public policy. As mentioned by the authors: \"[s]maller $p$-values do not necessarily imply the presence of larger or more important effects(…)\". In this case, finding a statistically significant variable does not mean their effect on education is large enough to become a good policy.\n",
        "  </li>\n",
        "  <li> Finally, the statistical significance of the variables is not an indicator of the underlying model being right. This, because the test was realized assuming the model was right. In other words, testing wheter a variable is stastistically significant in a certain model is not a test about the model assumptions. Wasserstein and Lazar (2016) elaborate on this mentioning that \"[b]y itself, a $p$-value does not provide a good measure of evidence regarding a model or hypothesis.\" Since we are only testing <i>one</i> of the infinite possible hypothesis, there is a chance another completely different model or hypothesis could explain better the data we have.  \n",
        "  </li>\n",
        "</ol>\n",
        "\n",
        "In light of these problems, a better framework could be combining statistical methods with experiment design improvements. First, and drawing from the paper, we could combine testing for significance with confidence intervals, likelihood ratios or Bayesian methods. We could also incorporate decision-theoretic modeling and false discovery rates. This way, we could deviate our attention from testing and focus on the estimation and the size of the effects that each feature has on the outcome. Another approach would be designing good RCTs that could shed more light on the effects that some variables can have on education. Evidently, this is a long and costly process and should be done with most caution and care, in order to draw correct conclusions and avoid bias.\n",

        "<font size=\"2\" color=\"#03bafc\"> The author proposes a simple theoretical framework to explain why many research findings in science could in principle be false. The three models Ioannidis proposes focus primarily on three parameters:\n",
        "<ul> <font size=\"2\" color=\"#03bafc\"> \n",
        "  <li> $R$, the fraction of \"true relationships\" to \"no relationships\" among the relationships tested in a given field. From this, he computes the pre-study (ex ante) probability of a relationship taken at random being true: $\\frac{R}{R+1}$. \n",
        "  </li>\n",
        "  <li> $\\alpha$, the significance threshold (i.e., the probability of claiming the existence of a relationship where is none).\n",
        "  </li>\n",
        "  <li> $\\beta$, the statistical power of the study (i.e., the probability of finding a true relationship).\n",
        "  </li>\n",
        "</ul>\n",
        "In his first model, the author compares in a contingency table (Table 1 in the paper) the expected number of studies that belong to each of the 4 groups given by: finding or rejecting a relationship, and the actual existence (or not) of a relationship. Under this simple model is that he proposes that a research finding is more lilely true than false if $(1-\\beta)R > \\alpha$. \n",
        "\n",
        "<font size=\"2\" color=\"#03bafc\"> This arises from the following calculation. If $c$ studies are conducted in a field, then a fraction $(1-\\beta)\\frac{R}{R+1}$ of them are true findings (computed as the probability of finding a true relationship times the probability of that finding being true). Also, a fraction $\\alpha\\frac{1}{R+1}$ of the studies are false research findings (computed as the probability of falsely claiming a finding times the probability of not being in presence of a relationship). Consequently, a fraction $\\frac{\\alpha + (1-\\beta)R}{R+1}$ of the studies are research findings (the sum of both previous ratios), and if one is taken at random, its more likely to be true than false if and only if the fraction of true findings is greater than the fraction of false findings:\n",
        "  $$\\frac{(1-\\beta)R}{R+1} > \\frac{\\alpha}{R+1}$$\n",
        "which translates to $(1-\\beta)R > \\alpha$. This condition is equivalent to the positive predictive value (PPV) being greater than 0.5, where\n",
        "  $$ PPV = \\frac{\\text{fraction of true research findings}}{\\text{fraction of research findings}} = \\frac{\\frac{(1-\\beta)R}{R+1}}{\\frac{\\alpha + (1-\\beta)R}{R+1}} = \\frac{(1-\\beta)R}{\\alpha + (1-\\beta)R} $$\n",
        "Indeed,\n",
        "  $$PPV > 0.5 \\Longleftrightarrow (1-\\beta)R > 0.5\\alpha + 0.5(1-\\beta)R \\Longleftrightarrow (1-\\beta)R > \\alpha $$\n",
        "Note that the PPV is nothing more than the ex post probability of a relationship being true. Hence, the Ioannidis' claim translates to: we could expect that a given research finding is more likely false than true if the probability of being true, after being tested is strictlygreater than a 50%. Of course, we could aim for a more strict threshold, but 50% is the minimum necessary to make the appearance of true findings more likely.\n",
        "\n",
        "<font size=\"2\" color=\"#03bafc\"> Later in the paper the author makes more complex assumptions and incorporates, separately, two variations:\n",
        "<ol type=\"1\"> <font size=\"2\" color=\"#03bafc\">\n",
        "  <li> Presence of bias, that is, the probability that a given study was passed as a research finding, although there was none.\n",
        "  </li>\n",
        "  <li> Presence of multiple independent studies, that is, the fact that many independent research teams are testing the same relationship simultaneously.\n",
        "  </li> \n",
        "</ol>\n",
        "These new models are summarized in Tables 2 and 3, respectively. These tables follow the same logic as the first one, where studies are split in four groups and the expected values computed based on the probabilites of belonging to each group, now including bias and multiple independent testing.\n",
        "\n",
        "<font size=\"2\" color=\"#03bafc\"> The main contribution of the paper is showing using a very simple framework that finding true relationships from published research findings is not as probable as we may expect. Moreover, the author shows to how extent different aspects of the studies are affecting the ex post probability of the finding being true. In this line, Ioannidis shows that the ex ante probability is one of the main drivers of the veracity of research findings. Statistical power and bias also have a important effect. In his closing remarks, the author provides at least three solutions: better evidence (e.g. large-scale studies in relationships with high ex ante probability of being true), pre-register studies to reduce bias (or at least adhering to a scientific protocol), and better undestand the range of $R$ values for each field (and promote fields where $R$ is bigger). \n",
        "\n",
        "In that sense, the lesson I learned from the paper is that we have to be very critical when interpreting results from studies. Biased fields can have many false results posing as true, especially if the study design did not achieve high power. The same can be said about questions that draw a lot of attention from the scientific and social community, in particular those that fight to produce a highly significant or strong result (although there may be none). For example, due to the pandemic a lot of interest was drawn towards questions about the effects that some policies could have on the pandemic control or the effects than the pandemic can have in different aspects of our lives. It is possible that the $R$ value for this field may be large (as there are a lot we do not know yet on pandemics), but there may also be a lot of bias in which relationships want to be answered and which pre conceived answers are expected. Moreover, many teams are tackling simultaneously similar questions, which as mentioned can produce false results. Last but not least, there is possible that for these questions is not possible to design good experiments and we must have to relay on natural experiments or country-or-state-level quasi-experiments, which have much less power.    \n",

The data include variables measuring climate characteristics (`JanTemp`, `JulyTemp`, `RelHum`, `Rain`), variables measuring demographic characteristics of the cities (`Educ`, `Dens`, `NonWhite`, `WhiteCollar`, `Pop`, `House`, `Income`), and variables recording the pollution potential of three different air pollutants (`HC`, `NOx`, `SO2`)."

First of all, looking at the population chart, is clear that two cities are considerable bigger than the others: New York and Los Angeles. Something similar happens when looking at the `HC` and `NOx` variables, where Los Angeles and San Francisco stand out from the others.\n",
        "\n",
        "<font size=\"2\" color=\"#03bafc\"> Another potential issue with the data is that `HC` and `NOx` are highly correlated (pearson correlation of 0.98). This may be due to cars or coal plants emitting both HC and NOx contaminants in a similar fashion. In order to estimate the effect of contaminants over mortality, only one of these two variables should be included in the regression model.\n",
